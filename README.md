## CurveMatcher

**Problem Statement:** How can I find peaks and troughs of a graph? How to find relative error and correlation between two graphs?

**Languages:** C++

**Build Tool:** CMake 3.5

**Additional Libraries:** Boost 1.61.0

**Github Page**: [https://apanimesh061.github.io/projects/curvematcher#part-ii](https://apanimesh061.github.io/projects/curvematcher#part-ii)

I will be discussing about the algorithms and techniques that I used to solve the above mentioned problem. I also made a console based application which accepts input from command line and processes them. The full console based project is [here](https://github.com/apanimesh061/CurveMatcher).

I tried to make a version of [CurveMatcher](https://github.com/apanimesh061/CurveMatcher) that runs on Visual Studio 2015 and a GUI interface using Windows Forms. The application has been named **FeatureFinder**.

**Languages:** Visual C++

**Framework:** .Net with Windows Forms
